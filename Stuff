Abstract:

Nowadays, Communications in IP Networks are heavily encrypted, making it difficult to analyze the ingress or egress network traffic. Furthermore, due to regulatory issues, payload inspection techniques are frowned upon and considered to undermine the 'neutral' nature of the internet. They also entail legal complications. This leaves IT administrators, ISPs and security professionals in a very difficult position, especially when it comes to ensuring reliable Quality of service and efficiently monitoring the flow of traffic in their network ecosystems.
This prohibition on Deep Packet Inspection methods and the contrasting need of being able to properly identify internet traffic has culminated in the birth of an entirely new paradigm which comprises of statistically analyzing the network flows. The statistical properties present in such network flows present an insight about the possible types of applications these flows might belong to.
Our work involves the classification of network traffic at Application Layer. We use a dataset containing the appropriate IP flow statistics along with the labels of application layer protocols for training our classification model. To ensure a valid and proper evaluation of the model, we generate an entirely unique and unseen network flow using an open source flow generator and test the developed model on it, obtaining encouraging results. As an added aspect of novelty, we programmatically modify the tool itself to automate the entire process of capturing the flows up to the point of producing the classification results, which is indicative of laying the foundation for a live traffic monitoring and classification module.
